‚ú® **Crafted with [Nx](https://nx.dev): a smart, fast, and extensible build system.** ‚ú®

Welcome to the chameleon project, a full-stack application that embodies adaptability and modern web development practices.

## Getting Started üöÄ

This section will guide you through setting up your local development environment for chameleon.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

&#x2705; Node.js (v18.19.0)

### Cloning the Repository

To start contributing to chameleon, clone the repository using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ionia-Devs/chameleon.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the chameleon directory:

```sh
cd chameleon
```

### Environment Setup üåê

1. **Create an `.env` file** from the `.env.example` template:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in the `.env` file** with the necessary environment variables provided by your teammate.

### Installing pnpm üì•

**pnpm** is our package manager of choice. To install pnpm, use one of the following methods:

- With Homebrew:

  ```sh
  brew install pnpm
  ```

- With npm:

  ```sh
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

After installing pnpm, install the project dependencies:

#### Access Points üåê

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:9991/graphql`

## Automated Database Deployment

### Overview

Our project leverages GitHub Actions for seamless database schema changes integration and deployment, utilizing IssueOps commands for efficient management with PlanetScale.

### Commands

- `/ps-create`: Creates a new database branch and deploy request for schema changes.
- `/ps-update`: Updates the schema on an existing database branch.
- `/ps-merge`: Merges approved schema changes into the main database branch.
- `/ps-approve`: Approves a deploy request for merging schema changes.
- `/ps-delete`: Deletes a database branch.
- `/ps-attach`: Associates a specific deploy request or database branch with the current GitHub branch.

## Branching and Pull Requests

We use feature branches for development:

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix. The branch name should start with the number of the ticket you are working on, followed by a descriptive name in kebab-case. For example, `32-example-branch-name`.
2. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages.
3. **Push your branch** to the main repository.
4. **Open a pull request** (PR) against the `main` branch in the GitHub repository.

For a step-by-step guide, GitHub's documentation on [creating a pull request from a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) is a great resource.

### Branch Naming Restrictions

Avoid underscores (`_`) in branch names, as PlanetScale does not allow them. Use hyphens (`-`) instead.

#### Example

- Good: `feature-add-new-table`
- Bad: `feature_add_new_table`

## Linking Pull Requests to Issues

For enhanced project tracking, ensure you link your pull requests to their corresponding issues:

1. **Reference the issue** in your pull request description using keywords like `closes`, `fixes`, or `resolves` followed by the issue number.
2. **Use the sidebar in the pull request or issue** to manually link to the relevant issue under the 'Development' section.
3. **Check your work**: When the PR is merged, the linked issues will close automatically, indicating the associated tasks are completed.

For more on linking PRs to issues, visit the [GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
